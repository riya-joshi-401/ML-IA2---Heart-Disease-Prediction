# ML-IA2---Heart-Disease-Prediction

<li>We have first performed EDA on our dataset and drew various insights from it</li>
T<li>hen we did some pre-processing our dataset</li>
<li>After that we implemented 7 supervised machine learning algorithms</li>
<li>We also did hyper-parameter tuning to further increase the accuracy</li>
<li>We evaluated their performance on the basis of various metrics and compared the overall performance of the algorithms</li>
